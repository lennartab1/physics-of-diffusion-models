# physics-of-diffusion-models
As part of my physics master I participated in a seminar on  Scientific Machine Learning. Here I chose the topic of Diffusion Models and since I enjoyed it quite a lot, I decided to make a tutorial notebook.
This notebook explains Diffusion Models from the ground up while focusing on their interesting connection to statistical physics.
I wanted to build intuition by shifting the view away from images to particles in a fluid and visualized this through animations of both the Forward as well as the Reverse Process.
I hope this notebook helps others strengthen their understanding and broaden their perspective on Diffusion Models from only image generators to models deeply rooted in physics.
